# Under the hood

In these exercises, we will be examining how OpenStack implements the
compute, network, and volume storage. You should be logged in to
the Rackspace instance where you installed DevStack. At this point,
you should have already launched an instance, attached a floating IP to it,
and attached a volume to it.

Do this as the stack user to ensure you can use the OpenStack command-line
tools:

    $ source ~/devstack/openrc
